# To install from a Brewfile, you use the ‚Å†brew bundle command. Here are the most common ways to use it:
# 1. If you're in the same directory as the Brewfile:
#    brew bundle --cask
# 2. If your Brewfile is in a different location, specify the path:
#    brew bundle --cask --file=/path/to/Caskfile
